# THREAD - AI-Native Messaging Platform

THREAD is an AI-native messaging platform that transforms everyday conversations into evolving, persistent memory threads. Instead of relying on channels or folders, THREAD automatically organizes your messages into semantic clusters that grow and adapt over time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Native Conversations**: Chat with Thread AI Assistant or invoke AI in any group chat
- **Semantic Message Clustering**: Automatically organizes messages into meaningful groups
- **Neural Network Visualization**: See connections between related conversations
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant communication with optimistic updates
- **Web Search Integration**: AI has access to real-time information
- **Voice Notes**: Record and transcribe voice messages
- **Knowledge Graph**: Build a living memory of your conversations
- **Contextual Search**: Find information based on meaning, not just keywords

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI
- **Backend**: Blink SDK (Auth, Database, AI, Storage)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 with web search capabilities
- **Database**: SQLite with automatic schema management
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

## üé® Design

THREAD features a neural-inspired dark theme with:
- Deep space background (#0F0F23)
- Electric purple/indigo accents (#6366F1, #8B5CF6)
- Flowing connections between related messages
- AI-first interface design
- Responsive layout for all devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Message Intelligence**: Every message is analyzed for semantic meaning
2. **Automatic Clustering**: Related messages are grouped into threads
3. **AI Integration**: Invoke AI assistance with @ai or chat one-on-one
4. **Memory Building**: Conversations build a persistent knowledge graph
5. **Contextual Surfacing**: Relevant past insights appear when needed

## üîÆ Future Features

- Advanced semantic clustering
- Cross-thread connection discovery
- Voice note AI transcription
- Collaborative knowledge building
- Neural network-based recommendations
- Adaptive UI based on conversation flow
